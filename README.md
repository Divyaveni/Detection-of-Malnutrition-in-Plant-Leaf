# üåæ Detection of Malnutrition in Rice Plant Leaves using CNN

This project focuses on detecting nutrient deficiencies‚ÄîNitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K)‚Äîin **rice plant leaves** using **Image Processing** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The study explores traditional CNN architectures as well as transfer learning and ensemble methods for improved classification performance.

## üìå Problem Statement

Nutrient deficiencies in crops can lead to severe losses in yield and quality. Early and accurate detection helps mitigate damage and optimize resource use. This project aims to classify rice leaf images into three categories based on malnutrition type using deep learning models.

---

## üß† Proposed Model

A **custom CNN architecture** was designed after experimentation with transfer learning models (VGG-16, ResNet-50, Inception). The CNN comprises:

* 3 Convolutional + MaxPooling blocks
* Flatten and Dropout layers (dropout rate = 0.5)
* Dense layers with 512 and 128 units
* Final Dense layer for classification
* **Attention mechanism** for improved focus on key regions

An **ensemble model** of three CNNs was also evaluated for performance boost.

## üñºÔ∏è Dataset

* **Source:** [Kaggle - Nutrient Deficiency in Rice](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guy007/nutrientdeficiencysymptomsinrice)
* **Classes:**

  * Nitrogen Deficiency (N)
  * Phosphorus Deficiency (P)
  * Potassium Deficiency (K)
* **Preprocessing:**

  * Resized to 256x256 pixels
  * Converted from RGB to HSV
  * Applied `MedianBlur()` for noise reduction
